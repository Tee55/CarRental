# Car Rental App

Car Rental App for Android and iOS. This project is part of the DES427-2 Mobile Application Programming course.

## Description

1. Must have a signup and login page.
2. The mock data should contain a fleet of at least 20 cars.
3. The data of each car should have the make, model and color of each car, whether a
   car is available for rent, and the expected return date of cars that have been rented
   out.
4. The data should cover December 2024.
5. A user should be able to search for the day (just one day) that they want to rent and
   see the list of cars available on that day.
6. A user should be able to confirm the rent and enter their name and driver license
   number.
7. There is no payment process.
8. A returning user should see the list of car(s) that they have rented.
9. There is no need to make the return system for the cars. A car is assumed to be
   always available on days that no one has booked it, even if it was just rented out the
   day before.
10. There is no need for the admin system, such as checking for all available cars,
    checking the status of each car, add/remove cars from the fleet, etc.
